## Documentation Sections

### Provisioning and Architecture

| Asset Name | Region 
| ------ | ------ |
| Primary Cluster | us-east-2 | 
| PR Cluster 1 | us-west-1 | 
| PR Cluster 2 | eu-central-1 | 
| DR Cluster 1 | eu-west-1 |
| DR Cluster 2 | ap-southeast-1 |

From an architectural viewpoint us-east-1 was discarded as the primary region and the most practical decision was to use us-east-2.

### Basic Accsess Catalog

| Asset Name | IP/Hostname
| ------ | ------ 
| Flask App | http://18.228.155.206:8000/ |

The following tasks are also complete as per requiredments of the primary cluster
1. init with keybase and auto unseal - no one person was exposed with all keys
```
vault operator init -recovery-pgp-keys="keybase:arielazem,keybase:richp,keybase:dawasz,keybase:redacted_ahead,keybase:lxhxr"
```
2.  Configured audit with syslog
```
vault audit enable syslog
```
3. Enable user pass auth method (more config reuiqred to write username/pw and attach policy)
```
vault auth enable userpass
```



### Database Dynamic Secrets Configuration
Database Dynamic secrets were enabled in order to work with the flask application following the steps below, for the MySQL/MariaDB database.

Database secrets were enabled:
```sh
vault secrets enable database
```
MySQL database configuration:
```sh
vault write database/config/my-mysql-database \
    plugin_name=mysql-database-plugin \
    connection_url="foo:foobarbaz@tcp(terraform-20200206144544828600000005.ccj5pugkq6mw.sa-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306)/" \
    allowed_roles="my-role"
```
Role Map configuration
```sh
vault write database/roles/my-role \
    db_name=my-mysql-database \
    creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO '{{name}}'@'%';" \
    default_ttl="1h" \
    max_ttl="24h"
```
Testing can be done with the next command
```sh
vault read database/creds/my-role
```

### Vault Agent Configuration
Enable App Role on Vault Cluster
```sh
vault auth enable approle
vault policy write token_update token_update.hcl (policy is needed for this app role where database/transit and s3 needed)
vault write auth/approle/role/apps policies="token_update"
vault read -format=json auth/approle/role/apps/role-id \
         | jq  -r '.data.role_id' > /opt/vault/config/roleID
vault write -f -format=json auth/approle/role/apps/secret-id \
         | jq -r '.data.secret_id' > /opt/vault/config/secretID
```
Policy (token_update.hcl)  
Define policy to allow token creation:
```sh
path "auth/token/create" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
path "database/creds/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "aws/creds/*" {
  capabilities = ["update", "read", "create"]
}
path "transit/+/orders" {
 capabilities = ["update", "read", "create", "delete"]
}
```
### Configure Vault Transit Engine
```sh
vault secrets enable transit
vault write -f transit/keys/orders
```
### Configure Vault Agent
Config File (/opt/vault/config/agent-config.hcl)
```sh
exit_after_auth = false
pid_file = "./pidfile"
auto_auth {
   method "approle" {
       mount_path = "auth/approle"
       config = {
           role_id_file_path = "/opt/vault/config/roleID"
           secret_id_file_path = "/opt/vault/config/secretID"
           remove_secret_id_file_after_reading = false
       }
   }
   sink "file" {
       config = {
           path = "/opt/vault/config/approleToken"
       }
   }
}
cache {
    use_auto_auth_token = true
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8007"
}
vault {
   address = "http://internal-a3970b95-vault-lb-1327631726.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8200"
}
# Consul Template block for database configuration
template {
  source      = "/opt/flask/mysqldbcreds.json.ctmpl"
  destination = "/opt/flask/mysqldbcreds.json"
}
# Consul Template block for s3 bucket configuration
template {
  source      = "/opt/flask/awscreds.json.ctmpl"
  destination = "/opt/flask/awscreds.json"
}
```

### Create ConsulTemplate
````
Template in /opt/flask/mysqldbcreds.json.ctmpl
{{ with secret "database/creds/my-role" }}
{
  "username": "{{ .Data.username }}",
  "password": "{{ .Data.password }}",
  "hostname": "terraform-20200206144544828600000005.ccj5pugkq6mw.sa-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com"
}
{{ end }}
````

### S3 Bucket Configuration
Consul Template awscreds.json.ctmpl
```sh
{{ with secret "aws/creds/my-role" }}
{
  "ACCESS_KEY": "{{ .Data.access_key }}",
  "SECRET_KEY": "{{ .Data.secret_key }}"
}
{{ end }}

AWS S3 Bucket configuration commands
```sh
vault secrets enable aws
vault write aws/config/root access_key=$ACCESSKEY secret_key=$SECRETKEY
vault write aws/config/my-role \
    access_key=$ACCESSKEY \
    secret_key=$SECRETKEY \
    region=ca-central-1
vault write aws/roles/my-role \
    credential_type=iam_user \
    policy_document=-<<EOF
{
  “Version”: “2012-10-17",
  “Statement”: [
    {
      “Effect”: “Allow”,
      “Action”: “s3:*“,
      “Resource”: “*”
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

### Run agent
```sh
vault agent -config=agent-config.hcl -log-level=debug
```

### Tasks that I would have like to complete if time allows 
-
The DR and performance clustes are stood up, but they are not fully configured to act as primary cluster or performance replica.
I would like to finish that part if there is more time/had I not encountered the blockers along the way.

-
Finished Setting up ssh secret engine to access company VM. This appeared to be a low hanging fruit for parts unlimited 
Following has been completed on vault cluster 
```
vault secrets enable ssh
vault write ssh/roles/otp_key_role key_type=otp \
    default_user=ubuntu \
    cidr_list=0.0.0.0/0
```
However I would like to finish configuring and test the ssh agent based on this doc to set up vault ssh helper on the target hosts

Configure AD/user pass for vault
